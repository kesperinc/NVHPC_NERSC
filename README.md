# NVIDIA HPC SDK Training (January 2022)

This repository contains the code examples that go along with the NVIDIA HPC SDK training session hosted by NERSC, OLCF, and ALCF (https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/nvidia-hpcsdk-training-jan2022/).

Each subdirectory has code examples for each of the different programming models presented at the training.

# Standard Language Parallelism

The `stdpar` directory contains examples of using Fortran standard language parallelism (`do concurrent` and other concepts) and C++17 standard langauge parallelism (`std::for_each` and related concepts).
